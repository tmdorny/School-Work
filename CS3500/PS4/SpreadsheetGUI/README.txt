I certify that the work to create this GUI was done entirely by myself and my partner - Tim Dorny, Tanner Marshall

Additional Feature(s)

For our addition feature we implemented a copy/paste feature. Empty cells are not allowed to be copied, 
and pasting can override existing cells.

Design Decisions

We followed the specifications as close as possible. We used a drop down menu for our new/open/save/close functions.
For our help menu, we used a simple messagebox.

Resources

We looked at a lot of microsoft documentation as well as a number of stack overflow topics.


Problems

UI testing was not working initially.
