1. Compile the java code in WEB-INF/classes: javac cs5530/*.java

2. Edit the web.xml in WEB-INF; replace Your Name with your first name
and last name.

3. Access your homepage via http://georgia.eng.utah.edu:8080/~5530ux
(replace x with your user id, e.g., 5530u01).

4. You can search by login using `user1' or 'user2', or search by director
name using 'Kubrick'. 

4. To work on your own database, you need to modify the credentials in Connector.java (so that it connects to your own database, rather than the class-wide database cs5530db). Note that the sample JSP code then will not work, since the "orders" table does not exist in your own database. You can always use the distributed script orders.sql (use "source orders.sql;" in mysql client) to re-produce that table in your own database, so that the sample JSP code will work with your own database. (be careful when doing this if your database already has a "orders" table from your phase 1; that table will be overwritten. To avoid that, change the orders.sql script to have a different table name, and also change the Orders.java code to query the new table instead).

5. Place any of your JSP pages directly under the public_html folder, and your java code
with the necessary package folder structure under the WEB-INF/classes folder.
You can then access your abc.jsp page from http://georgia.eng.utah.edu:8080/~5530ux/abc.jsp. And inside your abc.jsp page, you can import your java class (see orders.jsp for an example).


Notes:

-Keyword addition is found by browsing to updateTH.jsp and clicking the keyword button there.

-rate.jsp is a "helper" page used by rateFeedback to store feedback scores in the database.

-viewDates.jsp displays available dates for the provided hid and is accessable from reserve.jsp
so a user can see what dates are available for a given TH, does not modify database.
